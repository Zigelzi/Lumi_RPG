## Balancing sheet
The sheet used to balance the player and enemy characters: [Lumi Balancing sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XbHs-ho-ysb7dOO_xVHGT8jfR7gpk9tIH8WVWBeLwOQ/edit?usp=sharing)

## Player experience
Player is playing as Akseli, the guard captain of Pine Falls. Akseli was a skilled swordsman who knew a bit of magic taught by the ents in the woods. But due some reason, he has forgotten most of these powers when he begins his journey by waking up from the woods nearby Pine Falls.

The core player experience should be funny, but tell story of processing emotions through player actions.
