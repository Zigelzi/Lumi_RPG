## Playtesting @ 14.10.2022
Tested build 20221008 with only first scene, basic combat and basic abilities.

1. Finished the level with sword, level 2 and 150 HP
2. It was clear where to go, but not obvious that level is completed when boss is killed.
   1. Needs signposting to next level
   2. The portal to shop was disabled in this build, so it wasn't possible to continue
3. Better comabt and having fireball was fun!
4. Homing arrows and not being able to heal half of the time (?) were the least fun part
5. Combat experience was stiff / clunky, but improved from previous play test
6. Bugs / flaws
   1. First enemies floating
      1. Caused by bad navmesh
   2. No feedback from completing level
   3. Not clear what weapon is equipped and where to get better
   4. Fireball damage was too small, suggested higher damage and CD
   5. Possible to snipe enemies without them aggroing
