# Playtesting @ 3.10.2022
Playing through the game and writing observations about improvements and current player experience.

## Playtest 1 - Miika
1. Camera is very close, feeling claustrofobic andf hard to see and react to environment.
2. Hard to see the sword to pick up
3. Picking up health effect doesn't give proper feedback, doesn't feel impactful
4. Hovering over player is considered as invalid action, making movement unresponsive sometimes
5. Dead enemies just disappear, feeling janky
   1. Fade enemies or sink them to ground?
6. Non-homing projectiles are not flying towards the direction that shooter is facing
   1. Fixed for arrows, WIP for spells
7. Casting spell stops attacking and player doesn't continue attacking
8. Healthbar UI prevents clicking through, making movement harder sometimes
9.  Enemies give up immediately after player exits aggro range
10. Player can just shoot enemies from range without aggroing them
11. Death screen doesn't trigger when player dies
12. Player can't get through level without healing spell
    1.  Dies at boss
13. Playing through the left side of the village and clearing the enemies gets player to 1280 / 1600 xp
    1.  Desired is that player would be level 2 in the end of the level with sword and would unlocked healing spell
